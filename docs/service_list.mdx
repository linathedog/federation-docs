## Manage Ownership of a Service

Services are owned by groups of users. Members of the group can be simple members or group managers. All group members can view the service and also create requests for that service. Group managers can also invite or remove members to and from the group. When a user requests to registrer a service an owners group is automatially created for that service, note that the creator of this request is also a group manager.

## Review a Service Request (Users with reviewing rights)

Users with reviewing privileges are notified when a new request is created and is pending review. To find services with pending requests users can use the Pending Services filter.

By clicking that button a user can view the requested service configuration and submit a review using the review expandable menu. A review can either:

- **Request Changes**: reviewer can propose changes to the pending request by leaving a comment describing the changes that have to be made.

*Important note: Notifications are sent via email to the reviewers when a new request is created and to service owners when the request is reviewed.
