## Manage Services

Services can be managed by accessing the Manage Services page available in the
side menu on the left of the screen. In the Manage Services page a user can view
all the Services they own. Each Service is listed, the table as shown above.
Service owners can view basic information about Services they own such as the
service name, service description, the environment the service is integrated
(see [Integration Environments](#integration-environments)), it's current
deployment status (see [Deployment](#deployment)) and some of the available
actions for each Service.

Users can manage their services by creating service requests. A Service Request
can request either to register, reconfigure or deregister a service, users can
create edit and cancel Service Requests for services they own:

### View Service

Viewing a service configuration is available from the the view button on a
service list item. The full service configuration is split between two tabs, the
General Tab and the Protocol Tab. The General tab contains information described
in the
[General Information](https://docs.egi.eu/providers/check-in/sp/#general-information)
section and the Protocol Tab information differs depending on the service
protocol. For SAML services refer to the
[Saml Service Provider](https://docs.egi.eu/providers/check-in/sp/#saml-service-provider)
section and for OIDC services to the
[OpenID Connect Service Provider](https://docs.egi.eu/providers/check-in/sp/#openid-connect-service-provider)
section for more details.

### Create a Registration Request

To create a new service a user must create a registration request by clicking
the new service button in the toolbar located in the manage services page. This
button redirects the user to a new page where he will have to fill out a form by
providing the following information.

- General information about the service (Service Name, Description) located in
  the first tab. More info on the
  [General Information](https://docs.egi.eu/providers/check-in/sp/#general-information)
  section
- And more specific technical information in the second tab concerning the
  protocol of the service SAML/OIDC. More info on the
  [Saml Service Provider](https://docs.egi.eu/providers/check-in/sp/#saml-service-provider)
  and the
  [OpenID Connect Service Provider](https://docs.egi.eu/providers/check-in/sp/#openid-connect-service-provider)
  sections respectively.

### Create a Reconfiguration Request or edit an Open Request

To create a reconfiguration request for a service or edit a pending request the
service must be at a Deployed state. To find a specific service in the service
list view users can use the filters or the search box provided in the Service
List page toolbar and then use the Reconfigure button to create a request or
edit a pending request for that service. The reconfiguration button will open a
new page containing the current state of the service or of the pending request.
User can edit any of the fields and submit the request.

### Create a Deregistration Request

To create a Deregistration Request for a Service, the service must be in a
Deployed state. To find it in the service list view the user can use the filters
or the search box provided in the Service List page toolbar and then click the
more options located in the top right corner of the service box and select the
Deregister Service option.

### Cancel Pending Request

Canceling a pending service request can either be done in the more options menu
or in the edit request page (accessed using the reconfiguration button when
there is a pending request) by using the cancel request option.

Cancel Request In the Edit Request Page <ImageExpand image_url="/screenshots/cancel_request_form.png" />

### Changes Requested

A reviewer can request changes to a submitted request and provide some feedback
describing changes that need to be made to the service configuration. Service
owners will get an email notification and should login to the platform and edit
their request. Services that have pending requests with requested changes can be
identified by the Changes Requested badge next to their name and from the red
exclamation mark on the Reconfiguration Button. When editing their request users
can view the comment left from the reviewer. Submitting the request will resolve
the changes requested by the reviewer and Service will once again be in the
pending review state.

### View Service History

After a service is registered a user can access all requests that have been
reviewed for that service in View History page which can be accessed through the
more options menu in the Service List page located in the top right corner of
each service box. All reviewed requests are listed in the History View in
chronological order starting from registration. User can view each snapshot
which contains the full configuration using the View Button.

### Review a Service Request

To find services with pending requests users can use the Pending Services
filter. When a service has a pending request the review button will be available
in the service box item. By using the Review Button users can view the requested
service configuration and submit a review using the expandable review menu. A
review can either:

- **Approve**: approving a request starts the deployment of the requested
  service configuration described in the reviewed request.
- **Reject**: if the reviewer decides that the requested is not valid he can
  reject it canceling the request.
- **Request Changes**: reviewer can propose changes to the pending request by
  leaving a comment describing the changes that have to be made.

** *The Review option will be available to
service owners only for Services integrated in the development instance of EGI
Check-in**

## Manage Ownership of a Service

Services are owned by groups of users. Members of the group can be simple
members or group managers. All group members can view the service and also
create requests for that service. Group managers can also invite or remove
members to and from the group. When a user requests to registrer a service an
owners group is automatially created for that service, note that the creator of
this request is also a group manager.

Group Management Page View with explanations <ImageExpand image_url="/screenshots/owners_group.png" />

To manage/view the owners group of a service we must locate target service in
the List View and select the Manage Services in the more options menu. Once in
the Manage Group page the user can View group members

- Leave the group (a group must have at least on user and one group manager)
- Send an Invitation Link to an email address using the email invitation box
  (Only group managers, and administrators)
- View pending invitations (Only group managers)
- Renew/Resend an Invitation (Only group managers)
- Remove Group Members (Only group managers)

## Integration Environments

Using Federation Registry users can register their SAML and OIDC services to
multiple instances of EGI Check-in

- **Development**: The development is used for testing a service configuration
  and service owners can review their own requests.
- **Demo**: The demo environment is used to test Production Ready Services.
  Petitions are reviewed only by Technical reviewers.
- **Production**: The production instance allows members of the EGI User
  Community to access your service. This requires that your service meets some
  additional requirements such as a valid Policy Url and compliance with the
  code of conduct of EGI. In addition request have to go through a double
  approval phase from technical reviewer and a policy reviewer.

## Review a Service Request (Users with reviewing rights)

Users with reviewing privileges are notified when a new request is created and
is pending review. To find services with pending requests users can use the
Pending Services filter. When a service has a pending request the review button
will be available in the service box item. By clicking that button a user can
view the requested service configuration and submit a review using the review
expandable menu. A review can either:

- **Approve**: approving a request starts the deployment of the requested
  service configuration described in the reviewed request.
- **Reject**: if the reviewer decides that the requested is not valid he can
  reject it canceling the request.
- **Request Changes**: reviewer can propose changes to the pending request by
  leaving a comment describing the changes that have to be made.

\*Important note: Notifications are sent via email to the reviewers when a new
request is created and to service owners when the request is reviewed.
