## Manage Ownership of a Service

Services are owned by groups of users. Members of the group can be simple members or group managers. All group members can view the service and also create petitions. Group managers can also invite or remove members to and from the group. When a user requests to create a service an owners group is created for that service, note that the creator of this request is also a group manager.

## Review a Petition (Administrators Only)

Administrators are notified when a new petition is created and is pending review. To find services with pending petitions administrators can use the Pending Services filter. When a service has a pending petition a review button is available in the service box item. By clicking that button an administrator can view the requested service configuration and submit a review using the review expandable menu. A review can either:

- **Approve**: approving a petition starts the deployment of the requested service configuration described in the reviewed petition.
- **Reject**: if the reviewer finds that the requested petition is not valid he can reject it canceling the petition request.
- **Request Changes**: reviewer can propose changes to the pending petition by leaving a comment describing the changes that have to be made.

*Important note: Notifications are sent via email both to the administrators when a new petition is created and to service owners when a petition is reviewed.
