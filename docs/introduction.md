The federation registry provides a secure web interface through which service operators can register and manage their OpenID Connect and Saml based service.

Users in this system can view and also manage their services through creating and submitting petitions. Petitions can either request to register, reconfigure or deregister a service and are created by filling and submitting a special form. Once submitted users with reviewing privileges are notified and can view and review them. If a petition is approved then the asynchronous deployment process begins.

The following document will try to cover step by step all different functionalities and use cases. Users testing the application can follow these steps as a user guide but are also encouraged to experiment and try different things as the goal is to find issues, bugs and provide feedback.

The instance used for testing can be found at the following URL [https://federation.aai-dev.grnet.gr/egi/home](https://federation.aai-dev.grnet.gr/egi/home)
