The federation registry provides a secure web interface through which service operators can register and manage their OpenID Connect and Saml based services.

Users in this portal can view and also manage their services through creating and submitting service requests. There are three types of requests that can be made, registration, reconfiguration and deregistration. Once a request is submitted users with reviewing privileges are notified and can view and review them. If a petition is approved then it is deployed to the requested integration environment.

The following document will try to cover step by step all different functionalities and use cases. Users testing the application can follow these steps as a user guide but are also encouraged to experiment and try different things as the goal is to find issues, bugs and provide feedback.

The instance used for testing can be found at the following URL [https://http://aai.egi.eu/federation](https://http://aai.egi.eu/federation)
