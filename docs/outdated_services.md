## Why is my service flagged as outdated?

In some cases it might be necessary to make updates to the service configuration
in order to:

- Improve compliance with the technical and policy baseline of the
  infrastructure;
- Ensure the security and integrity of the service configuration;
- Comply with agreements with Peer Federations;
- Improve interoperability; All services registered in the Fedetation Registry
  should meet the technical and policy baseline. Each integration environment
  may have different specifications for the registered services. Services that
  have invalid values or are missing some required information in their
  configuration are flagged as outdated.

## What happens when my service is flagged as outdated?

If a service is flagged as outdated it continues to be functional and you will
get notified that you need to update the service configuration to follow the
technical and policy baseline. Notifications will be sent in a regular basis
until you submit a request to update the service configuration.
